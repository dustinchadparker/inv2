Daxko Interview Project
As part of the interview process, you will present a C# or JavaScript project that you
have written (by yourself!) to our team of engineers. The purpose of this part of the
interview is for us to evaluate your general knowledge of C# or JavaScript, good coding
practices, and communication skills. Instead of asking you to write code on the fly on a
whiteboard during the interview, we want to give you time to write code in a setting that
you control with your own tools so that you can be well-prepared for your presentation.
NOTE: we want to respect your time and do not expect you to go all out and spend
many hours perfecting this project. Please find the right balance of time spent on the
project to get to the point where we can have a good technical discussion around your
code. If there are areas that you did not have enough time to complete, come prepared
to discuss what you would change if you had more time.
Project Summary: Create a simple shopping cart API that could be used to support a
system that satisfies the user stories below (UI prototypes are included for context
around what this system might look like; but for the purposes of this project only the
supporting API, no UI, needs to be built).

Product List User Story: As a consumer, I want to see a list of available products for
order. I should be able to add multiple products to the shopping cart in one request.

Shopping Cart User Story: As a consumer, I want to see what is in my shopping cart
before checking out. I should be able to edit the quantities of each item in the cart and
delete an item entirely from the cart. I should be able to checkout, creating an order for
all of the items currently in the cart.

Order Confirmation User Story: As a consumer, I want to see a summary of my order
after I’ve checked out.

Technical notes
 There is no need to add functionality other than the user stories listed.
 This is meant to be a simple project that does not take away too much of your
time, so do not feel the need to create a full working system. For example, you
do not have to use a database if you’d rather mock the data in memory. Be
prepared to discuss which aspects of your code would be production ready vs.
areas that would need additional work.
 Feel free to use any tools or libraries that you see fit.
Interview Day
 On the interview day, you will be given about 30 minutes to discuss your project
with a team of engineers. Please come prepared to walk through your code, give
us a demo of running the code (including exercising the API calls), discuss your
approach to designing and implementing the API, how you went about testing it,
and what other changes you would have made to the project if you had more
time.
 Bring a laptop that can run the code.
 You will be presenting on a large TV or projector with an HDMI port as an input
(we&#39;ll provide the cable).
 If you do not have access to a laptop or a way of hooking up your laptop to an
HDMI input, please let your recruiter or contact at Daxko know as early as
possible so that we can make arrangements for your presentation.
