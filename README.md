## Daxko Interview Project

1. Product List User Story: As a consumer, I want to see a list of available products for order. 

2. I should be able to add multiple products to the shopping cart in one request.

3. As a consumer, I want to see what is in my shopping cart before checking out. 

4. I should be able to edit the quantities of each item in the cart and

5. delete an item entirely from the cart. 

6. I should be able to checkout, creating an order for all of the items currently in the cart. As a consumer, I want to see a summary of my order
after I’ve checked out.


Technical notes
 There is no need to add functionality other than the user stories listed.
 This is meant to be a simple project that does not take away too much of your
time, so do not feel the need to create a full working system. For example, you
do not have to use a database if you’d rather mock the data in memory. Be
prepared to discuss which aspects of your code would be production ready vs.
areas that would need additional work.
 Feel free to use any tools or libraries that you see fit.
Interview Day
 On the interview day, you will be given about 30 minutes to discuss your project
with a team of engineers. Please come prepared to walk through your code, give
us a demo of running the code (including exercising the API calls), discuss your
approach to designing and implementing the API, how you went about testing it,
and what other changes you would have made to the project if you had more
time.
 Bring a laptop that can run the code.
 You will be presenting on a large TV or projector with an HDMI port as an input
(we&#39;ll provide the cable).
 If you do not have access to a laptop or a way of hooking up your laptop to an
HDMI input, please let your recruiter or contact at Daxko know as early as
possible so that we can make arrangements for your presentation.
